WebLogic on Docker
===============
Sample Docker configurations to facilitate installation, configuration, and environment setup for DevOps users. This project includes quick start [dockerfiles](dockerfiles/) and [samples](samples/) for WebLogic 12.1.3, 12.2.1, 12.2.1.1, 12.2.1.2, and 12.2.1.3 based on Oracle Linux and Oracle JDK 8 (Server).

The certification of WebLogic on Docker does not require the use of any file presented in this repository. Customers and users are welcome to use them as starters, and customize/tweak, or create from scratch new scripts and Dockerfiles.

For more information on the certification, please check the [WebLogic on Docker Certification Whitepaper](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/weblogic/overview/weblogic-server-docker-containers-2491959.pdf) and [WebLogic Blog](https://blogs.oracle.com/WebLogicServer/) for updates.

For pre-built images containing Oracle software, please check the [Oracle Container Registry](https://container-registry.oracle.com).

## How to build and run
This project offers sample Dockerfiles for WebLogic 12cR2 (12.2.1.x) and WebLogic 12c (12.1.3), and for each version it also provides at least one Dockerfile for the 'developer' distribution, a second Dockerfile for the 'generic' distribution. To assist in building the images, you can use the [buildDockerImage.sh](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/blob/master/OracleWebLogic/dockerfiles/buildDockerImage.sh) script. See below for instructions and usage.

The `buildDockerImage.sh` script is just a utility shell script that performs MD5 checks and is an easy way for beginners to get started. Expert users are welcome to directly call `docker build` with their prefered set of parameters.

### Building Oracle JDK (Server JRE) base image
You must first download the Oracle Server JRE binary and drop in folder `../OracleJava/java-8` and build that image. For more information, visit the [OracleJava](../OracleJava) folder's [README](../OracleJava/README.md) file.

        $ cd ../OracleJava/java-8
        $ sh build.sh

### Building WebLogic Docker Install Images
**IMPORTANT:** you have to download the binary of WebLogic and put it in place (see `.download` files inside dockerfiles/<version>).

Before you build, choose which version and distribution you want to build an image of, then download the required packages (see .download files) and drop them in the folder of your distribution version of choice. Then go into the **dockerfiles** folder and run the **buildDockerImage.sh** script as root.

        $ sh buildDockerImage.sh -h
        Usage: buildDockerImage.sh -v [version] [-d | -g | -i] [-s]
        Builds a Docker Image for Oracle WebLogic.
          
        Parameters:
           -v: version to build. Required.
           Choose one of: 12.1.3  12.2.1, 12.2.1.1, 12.2.1.2, 12.2.1.3  
           -d: creates image based on 'developer' distribution
           -g: creates image based on 'generic' distribution
           -i: creates image based on 'infrastructure' distribution
           -c: enables Docker image layer cache during build
           -s: skips the MD5 check of packages
        
        * select one distribution only: -d, -g, or -i

**IMPORTANT:** the resulting images will NOT have a domain pre-configured. You must extend the image with your own Dockerfile, and create your domain using WLST. You might take a look at the use case samples as well below.

## Samples for WebLogic Domain Creation
To give users an idea on how to create a domain from a custom Dockerfile to extend the WebLogic image, we provide a few samples for 12c versions for the Developer distribution. There are two kind of domain samples 
  * The domain home is built inside a Docker image.  For an example on **12.2.1**, you can use the sample inside [samples/1221-domain](samples/1221-domain) folder.
  * The domain home is mapped into a host volume.  For the **12.2.1.3** version, check the folder [samples/12213-domain](samples/12213-domain). 

## Clustering WebLogic on Docker Containers
WebLogic has a [Machine](https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/12213/wls/WLACH/taskhelp/machines/ConfigureMachines.html) concept, which is an operational system with an agent, the Node Manager. This resource allows WebLogic AdminServer to create and assign [Managed Servers](https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/12213/wls/WLACH/taskhelp/domainconfig/CreateManagedServers.html) of an underlying domain in order to expand an environment of servers for different applications and resources, and also to define a [Cluster](). With some WLST magic, your cluster can scale in and out.

### Clustering WebLogic on Docker Containers on Single Host
You can deploy a cluster of WebLogic using Docker with the samples scripts defined in the folder [samples/12213-domain](samples/12213-domain). After you have an AdminServer running o container, you can easily create a cluster by deploying new Docker containers of Managed Servers. 

To start the containerized Admin Server, run

	$ docker run -d --name wlsadmin --hostname wlsadmin -p 7001:7001 --env-file ./container-scripts/domain.properties -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=<admin_password> -v <host directory>:/u01/oracle/user_projects 12213-domain

To start a containerized Managed Server (MS1) to self-register with the Admin Server above, run:

	$ docker run -d --name MS1 --link wlsadmin:wlsadmin -p 8001:8001 --env-file ./container-scripts/domain.properties -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=<admin_password> -e MS_NAME=MS1 --volumes-from wlsadmin 12213-domain createServer.sh

To start a second Managed Server (MS2), run the following command:

	$ docker run -d --name MS2 --link wlsadmin:wlsadmin -p 8002:8001 --env-file ./container-scripts/domain.properties -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=<admin_password> -e MS_NAME=MS2 --volumes-from wlsadmin 12213-domain createServer.sh

The above scenario from this sample will give you a WebLogic domain with a cluster setup, on a single host environment.

### Clustering WebLogic on Docker Containers Across Multiple Hosts
By using the sample [samples/1221-multihost](samples/1221-multihost), which contains a set of scripts that leverage [Docker Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/) and [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/swarm/), and by digging through the scripts that create the containers across multiple hosts combined with the scripts inside [1221-domain/container-scripts](samples/1221-domain/container-scripts), you can learn the necessary steps to deploy this with different Docker setups.

The basic idea behind this setup is that you must have all the containers across different hosts assigned to a specific [Docker Overlay Network](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/dockernetworks/#an-overlay-network), a feature of Docker 1.9+ that allows containers to join the same network, even though they are running at different host environments.

### Create a WebLogic Server 12cR2 MedRec sample domain**
The Supplemental Quick Installer is a lightweight installer that contains all of the necessary artifacts to develop and test applications on Oracle WebLogic Server 12.2.1.3. You can extend the WebLogic developer install image **oracle/weblogic:12.2.1.3-developer** to create a domain image with the MedRec application deployed.

  1. Make sure you have `oracle/weblogic:12.2.1.3-developer` image built. If not go into [dockerfiles](dockerfiles/) and call 

        $ sh buildDockerImage.sh -v 12.2.1.3 -d

  2. Go to folder [samples/1221-medrec](samples/1221-medrec)
  3. Download into this folder the supplemental package for WebLogic 12R2
  4. Edit Dockerfile to extend thye 12.2.1.3 image 
  5. Run the following command: 

        $ docker build -t 12213-medrec .

  5. Now run a container from this new sample domain image

        $ docker run -ti -p 7002:7002 12213-medrec

  6. Now access the AdminServer Console at 

        http://localhost:7002/medrec
