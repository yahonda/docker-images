Oracle Fusion Middleware Infrastructure on Docker
=================================================
This Docker configuration has been used to create the Oracle Fusion Middleware Infrastructure image. Providing this FMW image facilitates the configuration, and environment setup for DevOps users. This project includes the creation of an  FMW Infrastructure domain. These Fusion Middleware Infrastructure 12.2.1.2 images are based on Oracle WebLogic 12.2.1.2 Infrastructure image.

The certification of Oracle FMW Infrastructure on Docker does not require the use of any file presented in this repository. Customers and users are welcome to use them as starters, and customize/tweak, or create from scratch new scripts and Dockerfiles.


## How to build and run
This project offers a sample Dockerfile and scripts to build a Oracle Fusion Middleware Infrastructue 12cR2 (12.2.1.2) image. To assist in building the image, you can use the [buildDockerImage.sh](dockerfiles/buildDockerImage.sh) script. See below for instructions and usage.

The `buildDockerImage.sh` script is just a utility shell script that takes the version of the image that needs to be built. Expert users are welcome to directly call `docker build` with their prefered set of parameters.


### Building the Oracle WebLogic Infrastructure 12.2.1.2 base image
**IMPORTANT:**If you are building the Oracle WebLogic Infrastructure image you must first download the Oracle WebLogic Infrastructure 12.2.1.2 binary and drop in folder `../OracleWebLogic/dockerfiles/12.2.1.2` and build that image. For more information, visit the [OracleWeblogic](../OracleWebLogic) folder's [README](../OracleWebLogic/README.md) file.

        $ cd ../OracleWebLogic/dockerfiles
        $ ./buildDockerImage.sh -v 12.2.1.2 -i

### Building Oracle FMW Infrastructure Docker  Image
**IMPORTANT:**The Oracle FMW Infrastructure image extends the Oracle WebLogic 12.2.1.2 Infrastructure install image. You must build the Oracle WebLogic Infrastructure image. See "Building the Oracle WebLogic Infrastructure 12.2.1.2 base image".

Choose which version of the image you want to build, go into the **dockerfiles** folder and run the **buildDockerImage.sh** script as root.

        $ sh buildDockerImage.sh
        Usage: buildDockerImage.sh -v [version]
        Builds a Docker Image for Oracle FMW Infrastructure.

        Parameters:
           -v: version to build. Required.
           Choose : 12.2.1.2
           -c: enables Docker image layer cache during build

**IMPORTANT:** the resulting images will have a domain with an Admin Server and one Managed Server by default. You must extend the image with your own Dockerfile, and create your domain using WLST.


### Sample FMW Infrastructure Domain 
The image **oracle/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.2** will configure a **base_domain** with the following settings:

 * Admin Username: `weblogic`
 * Admin Password: `Auto generated` 
 * DB Schema Password: 'Auto generated'
 * DB Username: 'sys' 
 * DB Password: 'Auto Generated at runtime by DB container' 
 * RCU Prefix: 'INFRA6'
 * Oracle Linux Username: `oracle`
 * Oracle Linux Password: `welcome1`
 * Domain Name: `InfraDomain`
 * Admin Server on port: `7001`
 * Managed Server on port: `8001`
 * Production Mode: `production`
  

###Admin Password and Database Schema Password

On the first startup of the container a random password will be generated for the Administration of the domain. You can find this password in the output line:

`Oracle WebLogic Server auto generated Admin password:`

An Oracle Database Schema password will be genrated randomly. You can find this password in the output line:

`Database Schema password Auto Generated :`

If you need to find the passwords at a later time, grep for "password" in the Docker logs generated during the startup of the  container.  To look at the Docker Container logs run:

        $ docker logs --details <Container-id>

### Write your own Oracle Fusion Middleware Infrastructure domain with WLST
The best way to create your own, or extend domains is by using [WebLogic Scripting Tool](https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1221/cross/wlsttasks.htm). You can find an example of a WLST script to create domains at [createInfraDomain.py](dockerfiles/12.2.1.2/container-scripts/createInfraDomain.py). You may want to tune this script with your own setup to create DataSources and Connection pools, Security Realms, deploy artifacts, and so on. You can also extend images and override an existing domain, or create a new one with WLST.

## Building and Running the Oracle FMW Infrastructure Docker Image
To try a sample of a FMW Infrastructure Domain image configured, you will need two images, the FMW Infrastructure Domain image and an Oracle Database image. The Oracle Database image can be pulled from the [DockerStore](https://store.docker.com/images/oracle-database-enterprise-edition) or the [Oracle Container Registry](https://container-registry.oracle.com) or you can build your own using the Dockerfiles and scripts in GitHub. 

Follow the steps below:

  1. Create the docker network for the infra server to run
  
 	$ docker network create -d bridge InfraNET
  		
  2. Run the Database container to host the RCU schemas
  
 	$ docker run --detach=true --name MYInfraDB --network=InfraNET -p 1377:1521 -p 6500:5500 -e ORACLE_SID=MYInfraDB -e ORACLE_PDB=InfraPDB1 -e ORACLE_PWD=<DB Password> oracle/database:12.2.0.1-ee

      Verify that the Database is running look at the logs from the run command:
 
        $ docker logs -f <container id>

     You should see the string 

     #########################
     DATABASE IS READY TO USE!
     #########################

     The Database password is auto generated, one way to change the DB passcode 
        $ docker exec MYInfraDB ./setPassword.sh <DB password>


  3. Build the **12.2.1.2** FMW Infrastructure image. To build The FMW Infrastructure image run:

        $ sh buildDockerImage.sh -v 12.2.1.2 

  4. Verify you now have this image in place with

        $ docker images
  
  5. Start a container to launch the Admin Server from the image created in step 3. The environment variables used to configure the InfraDomain are defined in infraDomain.env.list file. Call docker run from the **dockerfiles/12.2.1.2** directory where the infraDomain.env.list file is and pass the file name at runtime. To run a Admin Server container call: 

        $ docker run --detach=true -i -t -p 9001:7001 --network=InfraNET -v <Host Volume>:/u01/oracle/user_projects --name InfraAdminContainer --env-file ./infraDomain.env.list oracle/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.2

  6. Access the administration console

        $ docker inspect --format '{{.NewworkSettings.IPAddress}}' <container-name>
        This returns the IPAddress (example xxx.xx.x.x) of the container.  Got to your browser and enter http://xxx.xx.x.x:9001/console
        
        Since the container ports are mapped to host port, you can access using the hostname as well.
  
  7. Start a container to launch the Managed Server from the image created in step 3. The environment variables used to run the Managed Server image are defined in the file infraserver.env.list. Call docker run from the **dockerfiles/12.2.1.2** directory where the infraserver.env.list file is and pass the file name at runtime. To run a Managed Server container call:

        $ docker run --detach=true -i -t -p 9801:8001 --network=InfraNET --volumes-from InfraAdminContainer --name InfraManagedContainer --env-file ./infraServer.env.list oracle/fmw-infrastructure:12.2.1.2 startManagedServer.sh
